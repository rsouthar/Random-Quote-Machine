# Random-Quote-Machine

This is a Random Quote Machine for FreeCodeCamp.org.  

I just used some Javascript to randomly go through an array of quotes.    A live demo can be found on my portfolio site- <https://www.richardsouthard.com/projects/Random%20Quote/index.html>

This is the final result of the project.
